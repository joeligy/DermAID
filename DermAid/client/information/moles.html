				<p>Moles are growths on the skin that are usually brown or black. Moles may appear anywhere on the skin, and can appear alone or in groups. They appear in the first 30 years of a person’s life (sometimes even present at birth), and it is normal to have between 10-40 moles by adulthood.</p>

				<p>Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. The vast majority of moles are not dangerous. Moles that are more likely to be cancer are those that look different than other existing moles or those that first appear after age 30.</p>

				<p>If you notice changes in a mole’s color, height, size or shape, or if the mole bleeds, oozes, itches, or becomes painful, you should have a dermatologist evaluate it. The mole may be removed by a doctor, if found to be cancerous.</p>
