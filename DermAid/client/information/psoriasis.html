				<p>Psoriasis is a chronic skin problem that causes skin cells to grow too quickly, resulting in thick, white, silvery, or red patches of skin. In psoriasis, new skin cells move rapidly to the surface of the skin in a matter of days, instead of weeks, which causes the build-up of thick skin patches called plaques. </p>

				<p>Plaques most often occur on the knees, elbows, scalp, hands, feet, or lower back. Psoriasis is most common in adults, though children and teens may be affected too. Experts believe the condition occurs when the immune system overreacts, causing inflammation and flaking of the skin. It is not contagious.</p>

				<p>Treatment for psoriasis begins with skin care, like creams, lotions, or shampoos. Things to avoid while afflicted with psoriasis include skin injury, stress and anxiety, infection, certain medicines, overexposure to sunlight, alcohol, and smoking. (WebMD)</p>
