				<p>Actinic keratosis, also called solar keratosis, is a precancerous skin condition that develops on skin, especially on the face, hands, forearms, and neck. It is seen most often in pale-skinned, fair-haired, light-eyed people, beginning at age 30 or 40 and becoming more common with age.</p>

				<p>The primary symptom is small, noticeable, lasting patches on the skin, which may be red, brown, or skin-colored. These patches may have a rough texture, itch, burn, sting, range from one to three millimeters in diameter or larger, and be surrounded by red, irritated skin. Such patches may also be numerous and close together.</p>

				<p>Actinic keratosis is diagnosed through a skin examination. Early treatment from a doctor is recommended to stop the possible progression to a type of skin cancer. Preventive measurements include staying out of the sun and using sunscreen. (WebMD)</p>
